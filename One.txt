 1.Describe the different between css flex box layout model and the css grid layout model. when would you like to choose one over others?

  Solution:
     
Layout Model:

Flexbox: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model. It is best suited for laying out items in a single row or column. You can create flexible, responsive designs for components within that row or column, but it doesn't work well for managing a two-dimensional layout with both rows and columns.
Grid: CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout model, which means you can create layouts with both rows and columns. It's ideal for creating complex, grid-based designs. You can use it to define the rows and columns explicitly.
Item Arrangement:

Flexbox: It's great for aligning items within a container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). Items can grow or shrink to fit the available space.
Grid: It allows you to create a grid structure with items placed within the defined rows and columns. You have more control over item placement in both dimensions.

Responsive Design:

Flexbox: It's excellent for building responsive designs within a single row or column, making it well-suited for items that need to adapt to different screen sizes.
Grid: CSS Grid is versatile for creating responsive layouts. It enables you to control the placement of items in a grid, which can adapt to various screen sizes.


When to Choose One Over the Other:

Use Flexbox when you need to arrange items within a single row or column. This is useful for things like navigation menus, button groups, and flexible content within a container.

Choose Grid when you need to create a more complex layout with both rows and columns, like a multi-column website layout or a grid-based gallery. Grid is particularly powerful for structuring the overall page layout.

It's also common to use them together within the same project, as they complement each other. For example, you can use Grid to structure the overall layout of a webpage and use Flexbox within the Grid items to control the alignment and distribution of content. Your choice depends on the specific requirements of your layout
